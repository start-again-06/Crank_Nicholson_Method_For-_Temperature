ðŸ“– Introduction

The Crank-Nicolson method is a powerful numerical technique used to solve parabolic partial differential equations, such as the heat equation. This implementation models the temperature distribution in a rod of length L = 10 meters, given boundary conditions at the base and tip.

ðŸ›  Requirements

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

pip install numpy matplotlib scipy

ðŸ“¥ Installation

Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/heat-conduction-solver.git
cd heat-conduction-solver

ðŸš€ Usage

Run the script to simulate heat conduction and visualize the temperature distribution:

python heat_conduction.py

ðŸ“Š Simulation Details

Rod Length: 10.0 meters

Thermal Diffusivity: 0.01 mÂ²/s

Boundary Conditions:

Base temperature: 300Â°C

Tip temperature: 50Â°C

Initial Condition: Uniform 30Â°C throughout the rod

Grid:

Nx = 75 spatial points

Nt = 1000 time steps

dx = L / (Nx - 1)

dt = 0.1 seconds

Stability Check: Ensures the numerical scheme remains stable (s â‰¤ 0.5)

ðŸ“ˆ Visualization

The simulation plots the final temperature distribution in the rod. The results help understand how heat propagates over time using the Crank-Nicolson method.
